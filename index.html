   <h2>Coronavirus in North Carolina</h2>
   <div>
       
   <p>Despite a substantial drop in the number of tests completed for the new coronavirus on Sunday in North Carolina, additional cases of the new coronavirus dropped only slightly from Saturday to 1,605, according to statistics from the N.C. <span>Department of Health and Human Services.</span> 
    <div>
    
</div>
    This is the fifth-highest single-day increase so far. All of the other top increases have come this month. <text>It brings the total number</text> of confirmed cases in North Carolina residents to 62,142. The number of confirmed cases in the state has more than doubled since June 3, slightly more than three weeks ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv"><p>Hospitalizations in the state continue to hover around the 900 mark at 890, close to the highest level they’ve been in the state since the pandemic began.</p></div>
<div class="parent">
    <p id="child">The number of counties with more than 1,000 cases each has gone up in the last few days.</p> While central Piedmont counties housing the state’s largest cities have generally led the way with the virus spread, more rural and suburban counties, including several counties in the West and East, have also seen a major impact lately.</div>
